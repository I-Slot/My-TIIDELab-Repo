// Js Fundamental
// Introduction To Javascript

// Variables
// Anything that is not constant, which means it has dynamic content(Value) most times.
/* Variable: Is a named container, used to save named value.
// When declaring variables we use 2 key words
 (1) let 
 (2) const 
 and the old way is by (var)*/
// Before ECMA Variable can be written as
// name = "Ismail"

/*Let key word */

// Expression
// Statement : A statement should be terminated when ever is declared.

let firstName = "Ismail";
console.log(firstName);
// The console is a debugging tool for developers
// The console are of 2 types (1)Terminal console And (2) Browser console
// The terminal console is used when javascript code is run in the node environment
// A website can be hacked through the browser console.

/*
Let : When let is used a variable can't be re-declared but only reassign.
 */
/*Variable naming convention
1- Variables name can't start with a number e.g 23House xxx
2- Variables must be space free

Variable Naming Styles(Contention)
1- Camel Case: e.g ismailAdesholaOgundele
2- Snake Case: ismail_adeshola_ogundele
3- Pascal case: IsmailAdesholaOhundele

*The standard naming convention in Javascript is Camel Case.
In PHP : snake case is the standard
